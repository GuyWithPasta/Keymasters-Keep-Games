# Games
## Clair Obscur: Expedition 33
Currently designed for up to the first half of Act 1 (finishing Ancient Sanctuary).

Future implementation include an option dictating how far into the game the player wishes to go.
## Kirby Air Riders
Tasked with Rider/Machine pairs, win on specific maps!

Note: Checklist Trials can appear for Air Ride, Top Ride, and City Trial.

Known Issues:
- Trials can appear with beating your Personal Best time trial. If your existing scores are too good, these may prove challenging
- Assumes you have unlocked all characters
- Trials can appear with obtaining additional Checklists for Air Ride, Top Ride, and City Trial. May prove difficult if the player has already completed their board

Future implementations include:
- Option: Remove certain game modes completely
- Option: Remove certain game modes from Checklist Trials
- Option: Add Online mode
- Option: Restrict Rider and/or Machine
